# Rommé Game Rules Collection

## A private History

My grandmother introduced my parents and my with gently force into this game.
Since then, I am playing this card game quick often an with lot of different people. Nearly every time (I am not lying) I play this game with someone unknown, a different kind of ruleset is bubbling up. Thats why I have decided to collect this rules into this repository.

## The Game as we play it

### Basics

* Two times 52 cards
* From two up to ten people
* The player who first managed to lay out all of his cards wins

### Preparation

* All cards are mixed well
* Depending on the number of players, the dealier is giving 10 or 14 cards to each person (the deck can never be empty)
* The person left to the dealer gets one extra card

### Running the game

* The person left to the dealer is the one who starts the game
* The game starter is not allowed to pull a card from the deck in the first round
* Each player can either fetchs the last card from the stack or pull one card from the deck
* After that a player can either put at least three cards to the table or add cards to other cards on the table (if this is allowed)
* Each player has to finish his move by discarding one card to the stack (also known as "Hümpel") beside the deck

### Rules to adapt

* Your first picture has to be at least  30, 45, 40 or 42 points high
* You are able to knock
  * Only if you have layed you first picture or not
  * You have to pull 0, 1 or 2 extra cards from the deck
* Ace is counting 10 or 11
* You are allowed to add a two to an ace when the ace has already a king on one side or not
* The number of jokers can be 0 up to 6

## Other Gamemodes

### Stev's Schleuder Räuber Romme (The Name is only funny in German)

The main idea for this gamemode is to remove the static order of people when playing multiple rounds.

* Create a uniform snippet of paper for each player with their name on one side
* Before each round, the person with the highest number of points from the previous round
  * Turn all snippets name downwards
  * Mix all snippets
  * Randomly place each snippet at a seat
  * Turn all snippets name upwards
  * Place each player according to their name on the snippet
* This won't effect the donor order
